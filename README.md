# OuttaTime

**OuttaTime** is a driver compliance and dispatcher communication web application. We’re still in our early stages, but if you're interested in contributing, please check out our [CONTRIBUTING.md](./contributing.md).

OuttaTime aims to simplify life on the road by providing drivers with:

- **Smart route planning** with weather, maintenance stops, and traffic avoidance  
- **Easy access to HOS logs** and pre-trip inspection reports  
- **Secure document sharing** with dispatchers — only with your permission  
- **An AI-powered voice assistant** to help on the go  
- **Driving scores and optional rewards**, at the discretion of your management  

Dispatchers benefit from real-time access to all necessary documents and logs without interrupting the driver — all through an intuitive interface and automated assistant.

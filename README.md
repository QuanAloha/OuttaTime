# OuttaTime
Welcome to the Outta Time driver compliance and dispatcher communication app. 
Currently, we are in our infancy, but if you would like to contribute, please check out
the contributing.md for further instructions. Outta time is a driver's compliance web app 
that allows drivers to easily communicate with their dispatcher in many ways. For drivers,
we have easy access to your routplanning including weather, vehicle maintenance stops, and 
traffic avoidance. We also have easy access to your HOS logs and pre-trip inspection reports.
And anything you upload to our service that you dispatch needs access to, they can have 
it with your permission, of course. Dispatchers have access to all necessary documents 
acquired along the way, and you don't have to worry about allowing access on the road, 
with or easy-to-use AI-enhanced voice assistant. Drivers also get driving scores 
with the ability to earn driving rewards at tye discretion of you management.
